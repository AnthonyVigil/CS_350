# CS-350 SingleByte Project
 - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The purpose of the Single Byte project was to use a single byte stored into the serial buffer. Characters were iterated by utilizing a switch/case to allow the user to type in on the console either "ON" or "OFF" which would be taken as an input to turn the LED on or off.
 - What did you do particularly well?
   - I feel as if I organized the diagram well and it helped me understand more of how the switch case will be utilized to get the actions needed done.
 - Where could you improve?
   - The code could be improved by possibly simplifying it such as creating less statements or cases depending on the requirements.
 - What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - I am adding the tool of using the Code Composer Studio for C on Microcontrollers such as the TI board used in this project. Previously, I had worked on an Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE but this was a bit more complicated when it comes to configurations so it was exciting learning how to utilize everything.
 - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
   - The skills I will transfer to other projects include best coding practices, code structure, architecture of hardware, and understanding the embedded systems.
 - How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - I managed to keep it maintained by focusing on the functionality and reusability. I wrote comments to keep track of the functionality and revised the adjustments if edits were made.
