# CS-350 SingleByte Project
 - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The purpose of the Single Byte project was to use a single byte stored into the serial buffer. Characters were iterated by utilizing a switch/case to allow the user to type in on the console either "ON" or "OFF" which would be taken as an input to turn the LED on or off.
 - What did you do particularly well?
   - I feel as if I organized the diagram well and it helped me understand more of how the switch case will be utilized to get the actions needed done.
 - Where could you improve?
   - The code could be improved by possibly simplifying it such as creating less statements or cases depending on the requirements.
 - What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - I am adding the tool of using the Code Composer Studio for C on Microcontrollers such as the TI board used in this project. Previously, I had worked on an Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE but this was a bit more complicated when it comes to configurations so it was exciting learning how to utilize everything.
 - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
   - The skills I will transfer to other projects include best coding practices, code structure, architecture of hardware, and understanding the embedded systems.
 - How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - I managed to keep it maintained by focusing on the functionality and reusability. I wrote comments to keep track of the functionality and revised the adjustments if edits were made.
   
   
   
# CS-350 Thermostat Project
 - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The purpose of the Thermostat project was to use the different peripherals that are built into the TI microntroller board, utilize the different methods learned throughout the course, and configure the assignment correctly. This project involved creating a code that allows the functionality of the thermostat, where the sensor is utilized to read the current or set temperature, and with the input of buttons allowing the user to change the set temperature by increasing or decreasing; This will turn on the heater and as it turns on the LED will turn on as well. 
 - What did you do particularly well?
   - Much of the time I spent was on trial and error but I felt as if I incorporated the built-in hardware features in the code well. The code is well organized and easy to read. 
 - Where could you improve?
   - The code could be improved by possibly simplifying it or understanding more of the peripherals in the code.
 - What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - I noticed during this project many students discussed their troubles in figuring out the temperature increase or decrease so it helped reading the advice and announcements from the instructor. Having other opinions on testing the functionality will help you understand the issue better.
 - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
   - The skills that I will be tranferring to other projects in the future are understanding, creating, and testing of system architectures involving microcontrollers such as the TI ControlPadXL. Coding and uploading it into the MCU then testing and seeing the functionality gives a sense of completion. Watching it all come together is interesting.
 - How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - I managed to keep it maintained by focusing on the functionality and reusability. I added comments to most of the code to give in detail of the functionality that is being done. During the loops, I added comments to show the logic behind it and follow the process.
